Professional stuff and interests on home page. But here's a bit more:

- born in India, moved right after
- childhood spent in Midwest, India, LA
  - in that particular order
- high school + college in the Bay

I enjoy:

- biking and walking with music
- finding new ways to use software
- helping other people

I like:

- sunday resets
- sunny in winter time
- jackets and formal wear
- every-day carry gear
- ambient lighting

I'd like to:

- get into short-film making
- get better at learning methods
- be employed
